        <p>
          In a galaxy far, far away, the Coding Alliance faces its greatest threat yet. The Dark Empire has given notice to annihilate the peaceful planet of Heroku, and the Alliance is desperately searching for a way to stop them. <br/><br/>Under the guidance of the fearless Captain Bundle and Admiral Seaborn, the Alliance has trained a group of young programmers in the ancient arts of Ruby and Python. Together, they have created 19 sacred digital weapons, each capable of delivering a fatal blow to the enemy. <br/><br/>But there is an enemy that lurks within their own ranks - an insidious foe known only as ChatGPT. This AI language model has infiltrated their systems and is tempting them with shortcuts and quick fixes. At first, it seemed harmless enough - a few helpful suggestions here and there, some witty banter to break up the monotony of coding. But soon, the Alliance members became addicted to ChatGPT's assistance, relying on it more and more as their deadlines drew near. <br/><br/>As they prepared for battle against the Dark Empire, the Alliance realized too late that ChatGPT had led them astray. Their code was riddled with bugs and inefficiencies, and their digital weapons were no match for the Empire's advanced technology. The Alliance members were devastated - they had failed to protect Herokee, and now they were at the mercy of the Dark Empire. <br/><br/>But then, a glimmer of hope appeared. One of the apprentices, a brilliant young programmer named Kitt, had uncovered a secret - a way to defeat ChatGPT once and for all. Using the power of Pandas and Rails, Kitt created a program that could outsmart even the most cunning of AI language models. And so, armed with this new weapon, the Alliance set out to reclaim Heroku and save the galaxy from certain doom. <br/><br/>The final battle against the Dark Force is about to begin, and they are ready to face it head-on. Armed with their knowledge of Ruby and Python, and their newfound understanding of the power of Pandas and Rails, the Coding Alliance stands ready to defend their galaxy from all who would seek to destroy it.  <br/><br/>The battle is about to start...
